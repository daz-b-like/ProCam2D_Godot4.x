## Overview

![ProCam2D Icon](https://i.ibb.co/s2Ht4RK/pcam.png) **ProCam2D** is a powerful and feature-rich custom 2D camera node designed for Godot Engine. It aims to provide developers with a AAA-quality camera system suitable for all types of 2D games. ProCam2D is a standalone camera solution that surpasses the built-in Camera2D node, offering extensive customization and control.

## Key Features

- **Standalone 2D Camera**: Works independently, providing advanced features out of the box.
- **Extensible with Addons**: Comes with three addons for mouse follow, shake, and grid movement. Developers can write their own addons to extend functionality.
- **Autoload Control**: The camera is controlled by an autoload called `procam`, making it easy to access all properties and methods from any script.
- **Multiple Camera Behaviors**: Includes 6 additional nodes to control various behaviors such as cinematics, magnet attraction or repulsion, zoom control, room constraints, path constraints, and target following.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the ProCam2D repository.
2. Copy the `ProCam2D` folder into your Godot projectâ€™s `addons` directory.
3. Enable the ProCam2D plugin in your project settings.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Add a `ProCam2D` node to your scene.
2. Add one or more `PCamTarget` nodes as children of the objects you want the camera to follow.
3. Configure the camera properties and target properties via the inspector.

### Example: Basic Camera Setup

```gdscript
extends Node2D

func _ready():
    procam.set_follow_mode(ProCam2D.FollowMode.SINGLE_TARGET)
```

### Example: Adding Addons

Addons can be easily added by dragging and dropping them into the inspector's addon array field or by code. Addons with the highest priority will bw run first.
If you added an addon through the inspector, you can access it like this:
```gdscript
func _ready():
    var shake_addon = procam.get_addons()[index] # Replace index with the index of the addon on the inspector. 
    shake_addon.shake() #Use this method to start any shake addon
    shake_addon.shake() #Use this method to stop any shake addon
```

To add an addon through code, use this method:
```gdscript
func _ready():
    var shake_addon = PCamShake.new()
    shake_addon.apply_preset(shake_addon.Preset.GUNSHOT) # See below for more info about addons
    shake_addon.shake()
```

## Addons

ProCam2D is designed to be extensible. You can create your own addons to add custom functionality to the camera.

### Writing Your Own Addon

Creating an addon for the camera system involves extending the `PCamAddon` class. This class provides a standardized way to modify camera behavior in different stages: `pre_process`, `post_smoothing`, and `final_adjust`. Each stage allows you to adjust the camera's properties at different points in the update cycle.

#### Addon Structure

An addon inherits from the `PCamAddon` class and should implement the following methods:

1. **`setup(camera)`**: Called when the addon is initialized. Use this method to set the initial state or configurations, such as defining the stage in which the addon operates.
2. **`exit(camera)`**: Called when the addon is disabled or removed. Use this to clean up or reset any changes made by the addon.

In addition to these lifecycle methods, an addon should override one of the following methods to define its behavior during a specific stage:

- **`pre_process(camera, delta)`**: This method is used for modifications to the camera's target properties before any smoothing is applied. Itâ€™s ideal for setting `_target_zoom`, `_target_rotation`, and `_target_position` of the passed in camera.

- **`post_smoothing(camera, delta)`**: This method is used for adjustments after the cameraâ€™s target properties have been smoothed but before final adjustments. Itâ€™s ideal for setting `_current_zoom`, `_current_rotation`, and `_current_position` of the passed in camera.

- **`final_adjust(camera, delta)`**: This method allows for final modifications to the camera's properties after all other processing. It is often used for post-processing effects or final tweaks.

#### Properties

- **Target Properties**: These are properties adjusted during the `pre_process` stage. They include `_target_zoom`, `_target_rotation`, and `_target_position`.
- **Current Properties**: These are properties adjusted during the `post_smoothing` or `final_adjust` stages. They include setting `_current_zoom`, `_current_rotation`, and `_current_position` of the passed in camera.

### Sample Addon: Grids

This addon aligns the camera's target position to a grid, ensuring that movement snaps to predefined intervals.

```gdscript
tool
extends PCamAddon
class_name PCamGrids

export var grid_size := Vector2(64, 64)
export var grid_offset := Vector2.ZERO

func setup(camera):
	stage = "pre_process"

func pre_process(camera, delta):
	# Snap the target position to the grid and apply an offset if needed
	var snapped_target = camera._target_position.snapped(grid_size) + grid_offset
	camera._target_position = snapped_target
```

You can then add it to the camera like so:

```gdscript
var grid_addon = PCamGrids.new()
func _ready() -> void:
    procam.add_addon(grid_addon)
```

### Implementing a New Addon

To create your own addon:

1. **Define the Addon**: Extend `PCamAddon` and set up any necessary properties or export variables.
2. **Set Up Stages**: Use the `setup` method to specify the stage in which the addon should operate. Implement the corresponding method (`pre_process`, `post_smoothing`, or `final_adjust`) to define the addon's behavior.
3. **Enable the Addon**: Ensure your addon is enabled by setting the `enabled` property to `true`.

This framework provides a flexible way to modify camera behavior by compartmentalizing changes into different processing stages.
